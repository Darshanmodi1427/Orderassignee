# Orderassignee
You can assign order to Sales Team, Packaging Team Or Billing Team(Users) with Due date assignment.

I have covered below functionality in this module.
1) I have added custom columns(Assignee, Due Date) in Sales Order Grid.
2) Added a custom tab as "Task Management" in admin sales order detail page.
3) "Task Management" form contains a Dule date and admin user drop-donw fields
4) Admin custom tab form save data using Ajax request.
5) Assigned orders will be display to that specific admin user only.

I have created this module if some one want to assign order to some different admin user with due date then this module will work fine.

I have tested this module in Magento 2.3.1 and Magento 2.3.2

Thanks
